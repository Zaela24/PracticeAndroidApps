# PracticeAndroidApps
Apps made in guidance with Google's free Udacity course - Developing Apps with Kotlin

## Archiving Notice
The two applications in here are incredibly simple and not particularly worth looking at. Additionally they were uploaded before I began using git to push my local repos, so many files are missing due to GitHub's upload limits when not pushing directly from a local repo.
