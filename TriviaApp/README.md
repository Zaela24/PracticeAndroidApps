# Trivia App
As I've learned more about git and GitHub, I have found out it is much easier to work on a local repo and push my changes to github than to try to push my files separately without a local repo. Because of this, this app and all future apps I make with this course will have their own repo, and this repo will likely get replaced.

Please check my TriviaApp repo, instead of looking in this subfolder
