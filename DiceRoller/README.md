# Dice Roller
A simple app to "roll" a six-sided die. Details are in the commit details for the rest of the files in this subfolder, however, I made a mistake -- the name of the course which I followed (Developing Android Apps with Kotlin) is in the README in the top directory of this repository, rather than in the repository name itself.
