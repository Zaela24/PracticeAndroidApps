# ColorMyViews App
App experimenting with constraint layout

This subfolder contains all source code in the zip file. To run in AndroidStudio, extract the file to where you keep your android projects, then go to file > new > import project > select ColorMyViews

Alternatively, you may load the APK directly onto a phone, though I'd recommend using AndroidStudio rather than directly loading an executable program from a stranger on the internet directly onto your device.

Some other select source files are included here for easier viewing, so you can look at some of the code without downloading the entire zip file if you'd like
